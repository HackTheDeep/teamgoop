The original presentation file was way too big for GitHub, so I took out the videos and split it into smaller parts.  Even still, some of the larger images were too big, including each slide in Part 3 (the examples of 'good' and 'bad' micrographs) and the 3-D reconstruction of Cyanophora at the end.
Part 1 is the title slide and background, including the Tree of Life and illustrations of the flagellar apparatus.
Part 2 is all taken from my published work on Ancyromonas and Breviata, giving examples of the micrographs and the models.
Part 4 is examples from my workflow, taken from the Cyanophora project.  As mentioned, the final image (of the reconstruction) was huge, so I couldn't include that.  If you have my paper, though, it was taken directly from that.
Part X is a couple of slides that I didn't use for the presentation, with two figures from another reconstruction project.
As always, I'll be happy to answer any questions about these.  It's been a while, there's a lot of detail, and I try to keep text as limited as possible in my presentations, so you're pre-emptively forgiven if you don't remember or didn't understand anything you want to know about now!
